<p>SmartTravel is dedicated to making travel simple

But it is hard to make things easy, so we have put together an experienced team with oodles of global experience in travel and ecommerce. Cleartrippers come in all shapes and sizes; and we are all passionate about just one thing - Making travel simple.

About Cleartrip.com
</p>
<p>SmartTravel.com is the travel site that gives you what you need without any annoying fluff. Who needs banners, pop-ups and blinking glitz? Search, book, go. That is what we are about - Making travel simple.

We made a list of some of the things we want to be:

Simple: Simplicity is a religion at SmartTravel. If we are not the easiest place to search and book your travel, feel free to give us a piece of your mind.</p>
<p>Comprehensive: Part of making travel simple is presenting you with all the options for your trip. We are working closely with suppliers to add more airlines and hotels to our search.</p>
<p>Reliable: Making travel simple implies making a travel site that just works and works. We still have the occasional hiccup, but being there for you, reliably, is very important to us.</p>
<p>Responsible: We take responsibility for what we give you. You will not hear us making excuses for airlines or hotels or availability or prices. If we show you a price, we will honour it, come what may.</p>
